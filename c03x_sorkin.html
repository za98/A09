<br>
	New York Times columnist and author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has been described as the <q>most famous financial journalist of his<br> generation.</q> His book, <em>Too Big to Fail</em>, was the first behind-the-scenes account of the financial crisis that led to our current recession.
<br>
<br>
	The Economist, The Financial Times, and Business Week all named <em>Too Big To Fail</em> one of the best books of the year. The book was <br>published by Viking October 20, 2009. The book was adapted as a movie by HBO Films and premiered on HBO on May 23, 2011.

	<li>Paul Giamatti as Ben Bernanke</li>
	<li>Billy Crudup as Timothy Geithner</li>

	<h2><strong>Movie reviews</strong></h2>

	<blockquote><q>Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of<br> the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but<br> the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing.</q></blockquote>

	<blockquote><q>I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their<br> families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.</q></blockquote>
